Thank you for visiting my personal page. My name is Tian Xia. I am currently a Ph.D. student in the Quantitative & Computational Biosciences program at Baylor College of Medicine under the supervision of Dr. Irina Larina. My Ph.D. thesis focus is developing computational approaches to analyze imaging data of mouse reproductive system and activity. Other than thesis projects, I have extensive experience in data science, machine learning, and computational biology.

Before my Ph.D. study, I worked as a research assistant from 2018 to 2019 in Dr. Robert Weinberg’s lab at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and in Dr. Yibin Kang's lab at Princeton University.

Research Interest
======
- Data exploration and modelling
- Machine learning (feature selection)
- Imaging analysis (object detection, segmentation)
- Computational biology (multi-omics data analysis)

Fun facts
======
- Living the purr-fect life with a trio of fabulous felines! 🐾
- I'm not just serving fun; I'm a pro at tennis excitement! 🎾
- Board games are my jam! 🎲
