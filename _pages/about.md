Thank you for visiting my personal page. My name is Tian Xia. I am currently a Postdoc at UTHealth Houston. My current work involving representation learning (unsupervised, contrast learning etc) on MRI images from UKBiobank and perform genetic analysis on these extract features. I had my Ph.D. at Baylor College of Medicine major in the Quantitative & Computational Biosciences. My Ph.D. thesis focus is developing computational approaches to analyze imaging data of mouse reproductive system and activity. Other than thesis projects, I have extensive experience in data science, machine learning, and computational biology.

Before my Ph.D. study, I worked as a research assistant from 2018 to 2019 in Dr. Robert Weinberg’s lab at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and in Dr. Yibin Kang's lab at Princeton University.
